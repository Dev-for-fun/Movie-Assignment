**Please make sure that you have installed dependencies**

### How to run both
- **for frontend:** npm run dev
- **for backend:** fastapi dev index.py



## Steps to run the project
1. Install NodeJS and run npm install to install the dependencies
2. Install the frontend dependencies also
3. Create .env file( for guidance see .env.example file)
4. use fastapi dev index.py to run the server of project
5. use npm run dev to run the frontend

### For dummy data dump using dummy data, uncomment the line 22 in index.py file and uncomment after that as its slow and I am still figuring out how to reduce the api time for it
